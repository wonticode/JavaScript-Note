# 22. Functions
Functions are pieces of reusable codes. e.g.
```js
function name (parameter){
 return parameter;
}
```
so here is the format to build a function. return keyword is used to return what the function is doing so, when the function is called it will become the result of what the function is doing e.g.
```js
function add (x, y){
return x + y;}

add(2, 5);

//whilst it is being called it won't log anything as add(2,5); basically is 7 but the code is not getting any command to log anything so rather--

console.log(add(2,5));

//this will log 7.
```
the 2 and 5 provided in brackets are called arguments. we provide arguments while calling a function.

**Additionally:** `includes()` method in JavaScript helps you check if a string or array includes a specific value.
