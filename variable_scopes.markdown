# 23. Variable scopes
Well, there are two types of variable scopes. Global and Local, global is declared outside of any curly braces and can be accessed anywhere but local is only accessible in the function or curly brace it is declared in. locals are just common named variables such as x, y, minimum, maximum but global variables are something that will be used everywhere throughout the code e.g. highestScore, etc.
