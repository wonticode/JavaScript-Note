# 12. ternary operator
It is basically a shorter way to write if/else statements but it is only useful when you do not have else if's. e.g. `yourMom == young ? "Yes she is young" : "Nope, too bad"`
so basically the condition goes before the `?` and you can see it like its asking what to check and if THAT is true, you log the first thing or make any changes, if false, it logs what's after the colon `:`.
