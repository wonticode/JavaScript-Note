# 50. Dates
Objects that contain values to represent date and time. These can be changed and formatted. 
```js
const date = new Date();

const year = date.getFullYear();
const day = date.getDay();
const date1 = date.getDate();
const hour = date.getHours();
const minutes = date.getMinutes();
const seconds = date.getSeconds();
  
console.log(year, day, date1, hour, minutes, seconds);

// 2025 4 14 1 24 21
```
There is not much to it but it is pretty useful.
